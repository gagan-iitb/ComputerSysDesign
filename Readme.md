Real life applications are complex and involve a variety of components (multiple clients, backend servers, databases, all connected by a network). We want our applications to be scalable, reliable
and performant? How do we go from the idea to the design to its implementation and successful operationalization?

This course is an attempt to teach the basic principles underlying system design, implementation, and evaluation of computer systems. It provides an introduction to the state-of-the-art analytic
modelling techniques that are used in computer system design. Students will also learn general systems concepts that support design goals of modularity, performance, and security. Students
will apply materials learned in lectures and readings to design, build and evaluate new systems components.

__Objectives:__

After completing this class, the students will be able to design their own distributed systems to
solve real-world problems. The ability to design one's own distributed system includes an ability
to argue for one's design choices.

The students will be able to evaluate and critique existing systems, as well as their own system
designs. As part of that, students will learn to recognize design choices made in existing systems.
Learning Outcomes:

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system
components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe:

• How common design patterns in computer system—such as abstraction and modularity are used to limit complexity.

• How operating systems use virtualization and abstraction to enforce modularity.

• How the Internet is designed to deal with scale, a diversity of applications, and competing economic interests.

• How reliable, usable distributed systems are able to be built on top of an unreliable network.

• Common pitfalls in the security of computer systems, and how to combat them.
